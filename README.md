_Printf
====================================================================
In this ALX SE project, we customized the C Printf.
This customized _printf writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout). If format includes format 
specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted
and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers
